# System_Verilog 🚀

Welcome to **System_Verilog**, a personal repository for exploring, learning, and building digital designs using **SystemVerilog**. This repository includes everything from basic syntax exercises to testbenches and project-based implementations — all simulated using **Xilinx Vivado**.

## 📘 About This Repository

This repo serves as a collection of:
- 🧠 **Learning Exercises** — Core SystemVerilog syntax and RTL concepts
- 🧪 **Testbenches** — Verification of modules using waveform simulations
- 🔧 **Mini Projects** — Functional digital systems designed and simulated
- 📊 **Waveform Outputs** — Simulation results viewable within Vivado or exported

Whether you're a student, hobbyist, or digital design enthusiast, you're welcome to explore and learn!

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Design & Simulation**: [Xilinx Vivado](https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado.html)
- **Target Language**: SystemVerilog (`.sv`)
- **Simulation Visualization**: Vivado's built-in waveform viewer
